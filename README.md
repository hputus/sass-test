Some tests using SASS

A small test using SASS. I copied the Cover Bootstrap template (here: http://getbootstrap.com/examples/cover/) and added the ability to restyle it using SASS. Simply change the $background-color variable in the cover.scss file, run "sass cover.scsss cover.css" in your command line and the page has been completely restyled!
